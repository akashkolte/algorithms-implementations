# üöÄ DSA Algorithm Patterns for MAANG Interview Prep

Welcome to my **Algorithm Patterns Repository** ‚Äî a curated collection of the most essential algorithmic patterns every Software Engineer should master before MAANG-level interviews.  
All implementations are written in **Python**, focusing on clarity, efficiency, and reusability.

## üìö Overview

This repository covers **20 core algorithm patterns** that repeatedly appear in top company interviews (Google, Amazon, Meta, Apple, Netflix, etc.).  
Instead of memorizing random problems, these patterns help you **identify problem types instantly** and design optimal solutions under pressure.
